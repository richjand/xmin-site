      <description>I’ve been interested in getting better with purrr’s map functions and have always wanted to get my hands dirty with the Spotify API so this post has a little bit of both. We’ll use the wonderful spotifyr package to take a look at trends in which NFL players are hot topics of conversation on top Fantasy Football podcasts.

As a Seahawks fan who spends a good amount of time online I’ve been exposed to a lot of discussion about the value of running vs. passing. A point used in favor of a rushing-focused attack is that good teams tend to run the ball a lot. This is usually met with the response that teams who are ahead will run to kill clock and minimize risk, meaning the causal arrow is backwards.</description>
