      <description>It’s not often I find a new base R function but a coworker recently put me on to one that I’ve been using a ton. Most of the R development work we do with the Reds involves developing inside of packages. That often means working with functions inside of functions inside of functions which can make debugging difficult when updating code.
debugonce() is a function that Hadley mentions in Advanced R Chapter 22 but that I had never seen and see very little mention of elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Fun With Spotify&#39;s API</title>

      <description>I’ve been interested in getting better with purrr’s map functions and have always wanted to get my hands dirty with the Spotify API so this post has a little bit of both. We’ll use the wonderful spotifyr package to take a look at trends in which NFL players are hot topics of conversation on top Fantasy Football podcasts.
The first step was to identify a list of podcasts and pull their information.</description>

      <description>Note: A slightly revised version of this post was posted at Open Source Football.
As a Seahawks fan who spends a good amount of time online I’ve been exposed to a lot of discussion about the value of running vs. passing. A point used in favor of a rushing-focused attack is that good teams tend to run the ball a lot. This is usually met with the response that teams who are ahead will run to kill clock and minimize risk, meaning the causal arrow is backwards.</description>
