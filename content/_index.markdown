Hello! I am a data scientist who currently serves as the Assistant Director of Quantitative Analysis for the Los Angeles Angels. Prior to my time with the Angels I got a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Michigan and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Washington. I grew up near Seattle and currently live in Los Angeles with my wife and our dog, Ralphie.
