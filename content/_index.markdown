Hello! I am a data scientist who currently serves as the Director of Baseball Analytics for the Cincinnati Reds. Prior to my time with the Reds I got a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Michigan and spent five years with the Los Angeles Angels. I grew up near Seattle and currently live in Los Angeles with my wife and our dog, Ralphie.
